        <p>
            Sea water seeps into the oceanic lithosphere through fractures and pores, 
            and reacts with minerals in the crust and mantle to form hydrous 
            minerals (such as serpentine) that store water in their crystal structures.
            Water is transported into the deep mantle via hydrous minerals in subducting 
            slabs. During subduction, a series of minerals in these slabs such as serpentine 
            can be stable at different pressures within the slab geotherms, and may transport 
            significant amount of water into the Earth's interior.
            As plates sink and heat up, released fluids can trigger seismicity and induce
            melting within the subducted plate and in the overlying mantle wedge.
            This type of melting selectively concentrates volatiles and transports them into the overlying plate. 
            If an eruption occurs, the cycle then returns the volatiles into the oceans and atmosphere
